# Task Description
Resolve GitHub Actions workflow failure caused by missing dependency lock file.

# Project Overview
3D portfolio website built with Three.js and an embedded OS displayed via iframe.

---
# Analysis (Research)
The workflow uses `cache: npm` and `npm ci`, both of which require a lock file. Repository lacks any lock file.

# Proposed Solutions (Innovation)
## Plan A:
- Principle: Remove cache usage and switch to `npm install`.
- Steps: Delete cache option; replace `npm ci` with `npm install`.
- Risks: Slightly slower dependency installation.

## Plan B:
- Principle: Commit a lock file to satisfy `npm ci` and cache.
- Steps: Generate `package-lock.json`; keep workflow as-is.
- Risks: Large diff; maintenance of lock file.

## Recommended Plan
Plan A is preferred for minimal changes and immediate fix.

# Implementation Plan (Planning)
Implementation Checklist:
1. Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to remove caching and use `npm install`.

# Current Step
Executing: "1. Edit workflow"

# Task Progress
* 2025-08-21 03:45
  * Step: Edit workflow
  * Changes: Removed `cache: npm` and replaced `npm ci` with `npm install` in both jobs.
  * Summary: Workflow no longer depends on lock file.
  * Reason: Prevent failure when lock file absent.
  * Blockers: None
  * Status: completed

# Final Review
Workflow updated to install dependencies without requiring a lock file.
