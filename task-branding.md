# Task Description
Remove remaining references to the original author by replacing them with Phuong Nam / Nam Techie branding.

# Project Overview
3D portfolio website built with Three.js displaying an iframe for inner OS.

---
# Analysis (Research)
Original branding detected in src/index.html meta tags, LICENSE.md, and readme.md. No textual match for the old company name; likely embedded in model textures.

# Proposed Solutions (Innovation)
## Plan A:
- Principle: Replace textual references directly in HTML, docs, and license.
- Steps: Edit index.html meta tags; update readme and license.
- Risks: Text may persist inside baked textures.

## Plan B:
- Principle: Recreate textures to remove original branding.
- Steps: Edit image assets with graphics tools.
- Risks: Requires design work outside code repo.

## Recommended Plan
Plan A for quick code-level cleanup.

# Implementation Plan (Planning)
Implementation Checklist:
1. Update meta tags in src/index.html.
2. Revise readme.md with new branding.
3. Change license header to Phuong Nam.

# Current Step
