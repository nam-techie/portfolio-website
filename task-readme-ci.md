# Task Description
Expand project documentation with a comprehensive README and introduce CI/CD workflow.

# Project Overview
3D portfolio website built with Three.js and an embedded OS displayed via iframe.

---
# Analysis (Research)
README lacks detailed usage instructions and there is no automated pipeline for build or deploy.

# Proposed Solutions (Innovation)
## Plan A:
- Principle: Rewrite README with full instructions and create GitHub Actions for build + Vercel deploy.
- Steps: Update readme.md; add .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- Risks: Workflow may fail without required secrets.

## Plan B:
- Principle: Keep README minimal and use existing buildspec.yaml for CI.
- Steps: Slightly improve README; configure external service.
- Risks: Less transparency; harder to maintain.

## Recommended Plan
Plan A offers clearer docs and GitHub-native CI.

# Implementation Plan (Planning)
Implementation Checklist:
1. Rewrite readme.md with features, setup, structure, and deployment notes.
2. Create .github/workflows/ci.yml running build and optional deploy.

# Current Step
